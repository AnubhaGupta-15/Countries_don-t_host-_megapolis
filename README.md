Case Study: Countries_don-t_host-_megapolis.

This repository contains a program that processes a global city population dataset to identify countries without any megacitiesâ€”defined as cities with a population exceeding 10,000,000 inhabitants.

Key Features:

Data Collection: Fetches a comprehensive dataset of city populations worldwide.

Database Storage: Efficiently stores the data in a MySQL database for optimized querying.

Analysis & Query Execution: Identifies countries that do not host any megacities using a refined SQL query.

Data Export: Saves the filtered results (including country codes and country names) in a structured Excel file, sorted alphabetically by country name.

This project provides valuable insights into global urban distribution, supporting data-driven research and analysis
